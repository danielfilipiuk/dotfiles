#       A wrapper function arount UM.Logger that allows debug level messages
#       to be removed by changing DEBUG_LOG_MODE.
# - log_debug():
#       A wrapper function around log() that forces debug mode to be on.
#       The idea is that you import it as log for debugging but switch
#       to regular log for release versions.
# - validate_int():
#       Tests a str value to make sure it casts to an int fine and optionally
#       constrain it to upper or lower bounds.
# - validate_float():
#       Tests a str value to make sure it casts to an float fine and optionally
#       constrain it to upper or lower bounds.
#------------
# v1: log() and log_debug() implementations including "dd" for debug that should show up anyway.
