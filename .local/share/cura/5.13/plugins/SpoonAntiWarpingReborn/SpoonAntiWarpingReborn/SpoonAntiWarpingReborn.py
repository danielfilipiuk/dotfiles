# A continuation of the "Spoon Anti-Warping" plugin by 5@xes 2023

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version history (Reborn version)
# v1.1.3:
#   - Spoons now hug the bottom edge of the model much closer (I think they're becoming an item!) if there's a chamfer/fillet/bevel on the bottom of the model.
#   - Print ordering is now aware of the existence of two digit numbers placed next to a "G" and will specifically look out for only the single digit numbers.
# v1.1.2:
#   - Spoons now have ironing specifically disabled in case you're using it in the scene. If you want pretty spoons, you can turn it back on in the Per Object Settings tool.
#   - Print ordering now takes G1/G2/G3 non-extrusion moves into account when removing combing moves because when I added checks for G2/G3 moves I neglected to add them everywhere.
#   - Print ordering now checks for Z hop moves which don't follow Cura's syntax in case another plugin or script decides not to follow that syntax.
# v1.1.1:
#   - Automatic spoon placement now follows the part of model that touches the build plate. Remarkably this took me less time than manually adding/removing spoons to about four complex objects with the original behaviour.
#   - If a model has separate areas on the build plate, they are now individually run through automatic placement. Reduces instances of monitor punching by approximately 93% compared to the original behaviour.
#   - Print order function now takes G2/G3 arc moves into account when getting positions and extruder values. It will never generate them because that math is beyond me.
#   - Setting to control density (minimum distance between spoons in crowded places like corners). Sometimes overlap parties aren't as fun as they sound.
#   - Fixed bug in logic that meant two spoons could be placed closely together if they were the first and last points in the convex hull. Sorry, my bad.
# v1.1.0:
#   - Added print order setting built into the plugin that allows you print all spoons before or after models. Doesn't require changing any print settings to work.
#       Gets rid of unnessecary travel moves to potentially the wrong place. Doesn't require setting up (other than picking something from a dropdown).
#   - Second bullet point to make it not seem like such a minor update. That thing was **a lot** of work.
#   - Added GUI control for print order script. Look, this is a big deal, alright? I need to pad the changelog out a bit.
# v1.0.0:
#   - Refactored the hell out of this thing. If you compared it to the original version, you wouldn't think the two were related. I don't think Git does, either.
#   - Qt 5 wasn't cute enough to be worth the effort maintaining it. Sorry :( This also means Cura 5.0 is required as a minimum.
#   - Translated a bunch of variable names from... I'm guessing Klingon? To English.
#   - The "remove all" function now steps on tiptoes so as not to break anything. It might leave behind things which are spoons instead of deleting things which aren't spoons.
#   - Removed the "initial layer speed" setting. Why should a plugin set that?
#   - Calculating the spoon angle no requires build plate adhesion to be on. It doesn't have to be off either. It's up to you!
#   - Removed the bundled post-processing scripts to focus on core functionality and shamelessly self-promoting my own scripts.
#   - Renamed "Direct Shape" to "Teardrop shape". Dear pedants: I know it's not a proper teardrop shape, but "plectrum" isn't well enough known, however I am open to suggestions.
#   - Renamed everything internally so you can have this and a different version installed side by side.
#   - Replaced icon on toolbar with something that doesn't look like a Rorschach test with only incorrect answers.
#   - Fixed logic that just made me go :/ in some functions. I'm reasonably sure it was wrong. It can be hard to tell.
#   - Deleted "logic" which seemed to not meet the definition of the term from several functions.
#   - Implemented input validation on the backend.
#   - Implemented "robust" amounts of input validation (with live feedback!) on the frontend. You can never have too much input validation, right?
#   - This validation makes it so you can't create spoons with invalid settings. I'm very sorry to the both of you who did that for good reason.
#   - Added version check and function wrappers to the QML file so the log doesn't get spammed with stuff that got deprecated in 5.7.
#   - Redid layout of control panel so it should respond better to different screen resolutions or whatever.
#   - The control panel UI should now better match the active theme. And if it did it right, no longer has visual glitches.
#   - Did I mention refactoring? Becuase I definitely did some of that. In the QML file. And more in the Python file.
#   - Added best workaround I've figured out so far for https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/issues/20488
#   - Rolled my own "notifications" system because I can't use UM.Messages ^^^^^. It's not pretty, but it vaguely works.
#   - Added checks to prevent spoons being added off the build plate if the ^^^^^ terror above strikes.
#   - Added completedness to a few functions which aren't completely used but are *technically* correct, the best kind of correct.
#   - Put in a bunch of type hints. Whether or not I'm running type checking is unimportant. What's important is that I'm less unprepared for it.
#   - Spoons will now automatically point at points (no pun intended) spread along the model's edges instead of just the corners.
#   - Went low-tech in my spoon detection system. Doing it by name. If you trip it up, there's about a 102% chance it was deliberate, so don't submit a bug report.
#   - No longer uses non-public parts of the Cura API. I've always been a stickler for the rules.
#   - Lots of calculations are now more precise. It's one of those things where you can't tell it's working, you can tell if it isn't.
#   - Implemented a legitimate use of seven different functions in a single line of code. That isn't a feature; I'm just bragging.
#   - Added enough logging to fill the Great Library of Alexandria. Twice. At least.
#   - Removed existing translation files. It can still be translated, but everything I've changed broke the existing one. Help gladly accepted!
