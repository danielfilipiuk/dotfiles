# Tab Anti-Warping Reborn by Slashee the Cow copyright 2025-
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changelog (Reborn version)
#
# v1.1.0
#   - Copied my patent-not-pending BaseDetect™ system over from Spoon Anti-Warping Reborn to place tabs around the object base, not the convex hull.
#   - Fixed a couple of minor bugs which wouldn't have been there if I was paying attention in the first place.
# v1.0.1
#   - Rolled my own notification UI as part of the tool control panel since UM.Messages hate both me and the support blocker tool.
# v1.0.0
#   - Renamed everything inside and out, so it won't interfere with other versions if installed side by side. Also so that it has the new name.
#   - Took out Qt 5 support resulting in requiring Cura 5.0 or higher. If this affects you, you probably should have upgraded quite a while ago.
#   - Removed "set on adhesion area" option. I honestly can't understand why it existed. If there's something I'm missing, by all means get in touch.
#   - Renamed "capsule" to "dish". Not my first choice but the inner construction brick afficionado won't let me call something that isn't flat "plate".
#   - Hopefully stopped the "remove all" button from removing things which aren't tabs. This might cause it to miss things which are tabs. I find this tradeoff acceptable.
#   - Cleaned up A LOT of code. When was the last time someone *cough* dusted this place?
#   - Refactor might be a bit of an understatement. I actually had to use AI to figure out what some of the code was or some of the variable names meant. Hopefully you don't.
#   - Redid the layout for the UI. Hopefully it doesn't look too different. Hopefully it's easier to maintain. That factor may be less important to you.
#   - Made the UI more responsive because there's lots of things neither of us have time for... I assume.
#   - Added copious amounts of input validation to the UI. Sorry if you were having fun trying to make tabs with invalid settings.
#   - Squashed a large quantity of bugs. My fingers are crossed that I missed the "fix one bug, add two more" paradigm.
#   - Implemented more checks to make sure Cura's settings are what they need to be for the plugin to work.
#   - Implemented UI explanations for why those settings need to be what they are for the plugin to work.
#   - Optimised some of the code. This may literally save you nanoseconds.
#   - Got rid of a whole bunch of docstrings that took up a lot of space but had very little to say in them. My linter is quite displeased with me.
#   - Tried to improve the linter's mood by type hinting a bunch of stuff. I don't think it's any more impressed.
#   - Put in a bunch of logging so when it inevitably fails hopefully I'll be able to figure out why.
#   - Had to put a Cura version check and add wrapper functions in the QML because in 5.7 they deprecated the way a tool accesses the backend in favour of a different way introduced in 5.7.
#   - Choice of density of auto generated tabs (minimum distance being radius or diameter) for those into Feng Shui and don't want clutter.
#   - Added checks to make sure a tab isn't created off the build plate, or too close to edge, since Cura's aim sucks and tries to put tabs way off in the distance sometimes.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# There seems to be a bug with UM.Message.Message that makes PickingPass go wildly off course if there's one on screen.
# Hence why I rolled my own. It's much inferior, except that it doesn't seem to break things.
